# STATS_101C_Kaggle_Competition

**Team 16**
Built multiple models to predict aluminum extreme-durability outcomes for the STAT 101C Kaggle competition, starting from a baseline XGBoost model and iteratively improving through tuning and feature engineering. Our best-performing approach was a multi-seed XGBoost ensemble, which reduced variance and achieved a public leaderboard score of 0.425920. This repository includes all model versions, experiments, and the final submission used by Team 16.
